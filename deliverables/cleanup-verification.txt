# Cleanup Verification

This file demonstrates that packet capture files are properly deleted when the annotation is removed.

## Steps:
1. Annotated Pod with tcpdump.antrea.io="5"
2. Verified capture files were created
3. Removed annotation: kubectl annotate pod traffic-generator tcpdump.antrea.io-
4. Verified files were deleted

## Before annotation removal:
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 4096 Feb  9 22:12 /capture-traffic-generator.pcap0

## After annotation removal:
ls: cannot access '/capture-*': No such file or directory

This confirms that the controller properly cleans up capture files when the annotation is removed.
